In software development, robust and user-friendly documentation is the gold standard. It’s expected, essential, and central to innovation. Clear documentation drives collaboration, reduces errors, and fosters progress. But why should this standard be exclusive to computer science?

Organic chemistry, with its complexity and ever-evolving nature, demands just as much clarity. Theoretical principles meet practical challenges, and misinformation can lead to costly mistakes. Yet, chemists often face outdated resources, inaccessible practice materials, and scattered information. Why is thorough, accessible documentation an afterthought in this field?

## The Case for Better Documentation in Chemistry

Imagine a world where organic chemists adopt the best practices from computer science:

1. Enhanced Collaboration: Well-documented protocols and reaction mechanisms enable seamless teamwork.

2. Error Reduction: Comprehensive notes minimize misinterpretations and avoid repeating failures.

3. Open Science: Shared, clear documentation empowers others to build on existing work, driving progress.

## My Initiative: A Step Toward Better Documentation

My frustrations were realized when I was studying for CHEM 3110: Advanced Synthetic Organic Chemistry Biological Applications. I was having a very hard time finding practice problems online that were free and were not in dense research papers. For this course alone, I compiled 600+ ANKI practice problems from different papers, sites and lectures and developed a free, open-access database for upper year organic chemistry students—or anyone passionate about organic chemistry. This platform offers:

- Detailed Reaction Mechanisms

- Comprehensive Overviews

- Practice Problems

- Proper References

Designed with a modern, intuitive interface in both light and dark modes, this resource aims to set a new standard for accessibility and usability in organic chemistry education.

## Final Thoughts

If computer scientists can set the gold standard for documentation, why can’t chemists? It’s time for a change. By fostering a culture of documentation in chemistry, we can make learning more accessible, collaboration more effective, and progress more achievable.
