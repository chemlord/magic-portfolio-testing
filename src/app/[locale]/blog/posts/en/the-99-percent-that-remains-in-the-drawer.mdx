## Motivation for Creating the Database

During the semester, I created and compiled over 600+ practice problems in ANKI. I believe these resources should not be hidden away—never to be used again. When I struggled to find reliable content, I was motivated to create a solution for students facing similar barriers.

## Introducing the Free, Open-Access Database

My project is a free, open-access database tailored for CHEM 3110 students—or anyone interested. It addresses critical issues head-on by offering a wealth of reliable content, including detailed reaction mechanisms, comprehensive overviews, and a vast array of practice problems. 

## Designed for a Seamless Learning Experience

With a modern, intuitive interface available in both light and dark modes, this platform ensures a seamless and productive learning experience. It is not just a study tool—it represents a movement towards more transparent and effective education in organic chemistry.
