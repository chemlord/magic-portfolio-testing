After using my previous portfolio for a couple of months, I have decided to upgrade my portfolio using Once UI.

I joined the [Design Engineers Club Discord](https://discord.com/invite/5EyAQ4eNdS) and they were extremely helpful to me. In this post, I will go over changes I made to my site over the magic portfolio template and how you can replicate it.

## Problems with my Previous Portfolio

I coded my previous portfolio myself using HTML and CSS. It was not very flexible to changes and lacked a modern look. Additionally, some information presented was questionable when placed under scrutiny such as:

There are several issues, including the inability to verify or quantify claims and statistics, as these metrics often lack concrete evidence. Other challenges include noticeable page breaks and inconsistencies with SVG backgrounds. It would be more appropriate to address these in an "About Me" section. Furthermore, attempting to add more projects or initiatives ultimately caused my site to break. Therefore it was necessary to retire it.

## How I made my Portfolio using Once UI

### 1. Deploy using Vercel

![Vercel](/images/gallery/vercel1.png) First step is to deploy the Magic Portfolio using Vercel. This step is quite simple and only requires you to link your Github Account to Vercel.

This step is mapped out very well by Vercel itself and is very self explanatory.

You can deploy and even view the Demo to see if you like it here: [Magic Portfolio](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/magic-portfolio-for-next-js)

### 2. Work in Progress
