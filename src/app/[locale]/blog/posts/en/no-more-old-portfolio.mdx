After using my previous portfolio for a couple of months, I have decided to upgrade my portfolio using Once UI.

I joined the Design Engineers Discord and they were extremely helpful to me. In this post, I will go over changes I made to my site over the magic portfolio template and how you can replicate it.

## Problems with my Previous Portfolio

I coded my previous portfolio myself using HTML and CSS. It was not very flexible to changes and did not look modern. Additionally, some information presented was questionable when placed under scrutiny such as:

Many problems such as being unable to quantify claims and stats as none of these metrics can actually be proven. Obvious Page Break and Inconsistencies with SVG backgrounds. **It is better to put this in an About Me Section. Additionally, adding more projects/initiatives ended up breaking my site.
